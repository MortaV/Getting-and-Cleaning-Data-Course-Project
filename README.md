# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository is used for Data Science Specialization (Exploratory Data Analysis part) peer assignment.

There are 3 files in it:
* **CodeBook.md** - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations used to clean up the data;
* **README.md** - current file, explains how all files under this repository are connected and how they should be used;
* **run_analysis.R** - R script which takes raw data, converts it to a tidy data set and produces a txt file with tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
