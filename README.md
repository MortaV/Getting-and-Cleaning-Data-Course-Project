There are 3 files in it:

* **README.md** - current file, explains how all files under this repository are connected and how they should be used;
* **run_analysis.R** - R script which takes raw data, converts it to a tidy data set and produces a txt file with tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
