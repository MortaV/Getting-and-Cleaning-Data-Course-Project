## Raw Data
 Raw data for this project can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). As it is described by original data owners, data set contains:
 >The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

More information about it can be found in the experiment's official page  [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Transformations

As the original data set did not met the conditions of a tidy data set, there were several transformations applied to it. The R code which takes raw data set and transforms it to tidy one is provided in this repository and is called *run_analysis.R*. It includes:

### Transformations of original data set

 1. Download the zip file with the raw data set and all additional files to a folder called *data* (if such folder doesn't exist in the working directory, it is created).
 2. Unzip downloaded folder.
 3. Train and Test files are joined with activity and subject information, column names from *features.txt* are added.
 4. Train and Test sets from step 3 are bind together.
 5. Only measures containing *mean()* or *std()* are left.
 6. Activity names are added as *activity* from *activity_labels.txt*.
 7. Activity IDs are removed as they are not informative.
 8. Column names are changed:
    + column names representing measures are gathered to one column called *dimension*;
    + *dimension* is separated into 3 different columns *signal*, *value* and *direction* by "-" as a separator;
    + *signal* is spread again into *domaintype* (first character of *signal*) and *signal* (everything except the first character of *signal*);
    + *domaintype* value is changed to "Time" if *domaintype* is "t" and "Frequency" otherwise;
    + *signal* is given several changes:
      - *Acc* changed to *Accelerometer*;
      - *Gyro* changed to *Gyroscope*;
      - *Mag* changed to *Magnitude*;
      - *BodyBody* changed to *Body* (probably it was just a typo in the original data set).
    + *value* changed to "Mean" if it was "mean()" before or to "StDev" otherwise;
    + *direction* changed to "withoutaxis" if value was NA, or to *direction*+"axis" otherwise.
9. *domaintype*, *signal*, *value* and *direction* were united back to a column named *measuretospread* (without any separator);
10. Dummy variable (rank of row number in a group of *activity*, *subject* and *measuretospread*) was created to spread *measuretospread* back to column names. After this transformation, dummy variable was deleted.
11. Data set was ungrouped.

### Transformations of individual second data set

1. Tidy version of original data set is grouped by *activity* and *subject*.
2. Arithmetic average of each variable is calculated.
3. Names of arithmetic average columns are changed to "MeanOf"+original column name.
